# SKIN-CANCER-DETECTION
 Skin cancer is a serious problem faced by people today. Skin cancer detection is a new way to diagnose skin cancer using images of dermatological locations using image processing. Skin cancer is currently one of the most common human diseases. This method is based on Fourier analysis using filters such as classical, inverse and k-law wireless. The imaging models are viewed by experts as a replacement for advanced imaging techniques that measure the size of complex skin cancer cells. Finally, an index that detects various cancer symptoms is calculated. Our results show a confidence level of 95.4%. The main cause of cancer is the sun. Ozone is the degradation and constant exposure to chemicals that are carcinogenic, among other things. Mutations in the p53 gene play a role in UV-induced cancer. The p53 gene plays an important developmental role in SCC.
